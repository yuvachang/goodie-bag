## Requirements

The requirements below are broken into step-by-step instructions, which model the way we **recommend you approach the project**.

### Get all candies in the goodie bag

#### Backend

- [x ] Write a `candies` model with the following information:
  - [x ] name - not empty or null
  - [x ] description - not empty or null
  - [x ] quantity - cannot exceed 10 of the same candy in your goodie bag
  - [x ] imageUrl - with a default value
- [x ] Write a route to serve up all candies

#### Frontend
- [x ] Write a candies sub-reducer to manage candies in your Redux store
- [x ] Write a component to display a list of all candies
- [x ] Display the all-candies component when the url matches `/candies`
- [x ] Add links to the navbar that can be used to navigate to the all-candies view and the home view (`/`)

Remember to commit early and often as you're working!

### Extra

If you finish the above 'get all candies' functionality, feel free to branch out and add some more functionality! Here's some suggestions:

- Get single candy
  - Navigating to `/candies/:id` will display all detail about that candy
  - Clicking on a candy in the all-candies view will navigate to that candy's single view
- Update candy quantity
  - The single candy view has 2 buttons, to increase or decrease that candy's quantity
- Go wild on the UI!
  - Try out some UI libraries like Material, Bootstrap, or Semantic... to name a few
